# UX & QA Black-Box Reviews

**Author:** Mpumelelo T. Nxazonke

**Focus:** QA-driven UX analysis · System thinking · Professional feedback

## Purpose

This repository contains **black-box UX and QA reviews** of publicly accessible web applications and portfolios.

The goal is **not criticism**, but to:

- Demonstrate *SDET-level evaluation skills*
- Apply *quality engineering principles* to real systems
- Identify usability, accessibility, and reliability risks
- Practice *structured, professional feedback* without code access

All reviews are conducted **without repository access**, based solely on:

- Public UI behavior
- User flows
- Browser-based observation
- Industry best practices

## What These Reviews Are

* Manual QA & UX assessments
* User-first/Recruiter perspective
* Evidence-based (screenshots, flows, reproducible steps)
* Framework-agnostic
* Written in professional, neutral language

## What These Reviews Are NOT

- Personal attacks
- Skill judgments of the developer
- Claims about internal code quality
- Security exploitation
- Commercial audits

Each review evaluates **the product experience**, not the person.

1. Context & intent clarity
2. UX & information architecture
3. Navigation & interaction
